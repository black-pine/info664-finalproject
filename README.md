## Pratt Info-664 Programming for Cultural Heritage
This repository contains the files for the final project for PFCH, completed in the Spring 2021 semester.  This project is focused around the comic book industry and single issue sales data.\
\
To re-use this project code, an API key is required for both the Marvel API (marvelAPI.py) and Twitter API (randomizeTweet.py).  There also must be a "records" folder in the same directory as the project files in order to save the Marvel API .JSON files (marvelAPI.py).  The order to run the files is: webScrapeMayo.py, calculateStats.py, calculateMarvel.py, marvelAPI.py, globMarvel.py, randomizeTweet.py.  This project will create .CSV, .JSON, and .XLSX files.
